## Description

This application serves as the foundation for a full stack social network application utilizing MongoDB as the database, Express.js for routing, and the Mongoose ODM. It establishes the initial CRUD API routes, enabling user creation, search, update, and deletion. Users can also share thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, create friend lists, and subsequently delete thoughts, reactions, friends, and their own user profile. While the application is still in its early stages, the integration of the MongoDB database and API middleware routing represents a pivotal initial step in exploring the capabilities of MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM.
During the development process, several challenges emerged. Despite MongoDB offering more flexibility compared to SQL databases when it comes to querying and adding data, troubleshooting became more challenging due to elusive errors. Additionally, identifying the most efficient methods for cascading data deletion and managing join tables posed difficulties. MongoDB's reduced code requirement compared to SQL databases presented a learning curve as it operates differently behind the scenes, and I am still in the process of fully comprehending its intricacies.
Despite these challenges, I gained proficiency in another powerful tool within the MERN stack, expanding my knowledge of full stack development. Moving forward, I intend to enhance this application by incorporating a comprehensive front-end UI with React, thus creating a complete MERN-based full stack application.

## Technologies Used

This application is powered by Node.js (v16.19.1), Express.js (v.14.18.2), JavaScript, MongoDB, and Mongoose (ODM). It utilizes the node package manager (npm) dependencies express (v4.18.2), and mongoose (v7.2.2). Nodemon (v2.0.22) was utilized as a devDependency allowing the server to refresh when edits were made to application. Jest (v.29.5.0) is installed as a devDependency for future unit testing. MongoDB Compass acted as the interactive shell used to visually see the database. Also, the Insomnia application, was utilized to test the functionality of routes within the program.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone git@github.com:Slfdspln/Social-Network-API.git 

2. Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

3. Using the terminal, install node.js v16. If you have homebrew, the command should look like the following (brew install node@16), however this may vary and the documentation should be consulted.

4. Once node.js v16 is installed, in the terminal, utilize the command npm init -y to initialize and create a package.json where project files will be stored.

5. Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i to install the dependencies associated with this application (developers may need to install dependencies directly from the command line).

   Commands to install each dependency:

   - Command for express will be npm i express@4.18.2
   - Command for mongoose will be npm i mongoose
   - Command for nodemon will be npm i nodemon
   - Command for jest will be npm i jest

6. Next, you will want to make sure you have access to a MongoDB account and MongoDB Compass, these will allow you to interact with the database and visually confirm what changes are being made in the database. (Link for MongoDB & MongoDB Compass download -> https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb).

7. Once all dependencies are installed, you will then be able to run the command npm start from the root directory to spin up the server. With nodemon installed, you will also be able to utilize the command npm run dev to keep the server spun up between code edits.

8. From there, you can utilize applications such as Insomnia to test the functionality of the API routes within the program and make edits to the code base (Link to install Insomnia -> https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/install).

## Features

Features of this application include the ability to create users/thoughts, find all users/thoughts, find a single user/single thought, update user/thought information, and delete a user/thought. The ability to add reactions to particular thoughts, and friends to users is also a notable feature -> when a thought, reaction, or friend is added to the database, it will update within the user object accordingly.

## Usage Information

As of now the usage of this application can be conducted through spinning up the server with npm run start or nodemon with npm run dev, then heading over to an application like Insomnia or Postman and testing different API end points. For further information on starting up the server, MongoDB Compass and MongoDB installation navigate to the Installation section above.

## Suggested Future Development

- Add additional seed data with the node package manager faker-js
- Continue development of additional routes adding likes or up-votes
- Create a front-end UI that will enable users to interact with the application in a cohesive and intuitive way
- Include unit testing with Jest

## Contribution Guidelines
